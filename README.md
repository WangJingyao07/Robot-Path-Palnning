该项目共包含三个文件夹，分别是机器人路径规划中的三类算法：基于采样的路径规划，基于搜索的路径规划，以及高维空间路径规划（基于深度学习等）。

### Search-based and Sampling-based
前两者包含了相应类别方法中最重要的几种，相关综述可见：

### 高维空间路径规划
主要针对高自由度机械臂，多舵机机器人，UAV等（特种）类型，文件夹中主要包含了：

- 6DOF机械臂的数据示例

- 论文中改进后的部分baselines

- 另外还包含了四个压缩包，其中HDPP为代码核心，由于上传的文件容量的局限，因此选择压缩后上传。

- 论文中所采用的gazebo环境如有需要，请告知邮箱后发送下载link。

Including famous approaches of robot path planning, novel method-HDPP and the baseline algorithm of the paper

This folder is a typical algorithm in path planning research, and the related paper links of high-dimensional space planning (HDPP) are as follows:

https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/12/9/4695

The project contains three folders, which are three types of algorithms in robot path planning: sampling-based path planning, search-based path planning, and high-dimensional space path planning (based on deep learning, etc.).

### Search-based and Sampling-based
The first two include the most important types of methods in the corresponding categories, and the related reviews can be found in:

- https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0140366419308539

- https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214914718305130

- https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/10/10/450

### High-dimensional space path planning
Mainly for high-degree-of-freedom robotic arms, multi-steering robots, UAV and other (special) types, the folder mainly contains:

- Data example of 6DOF robotic arm

- Improved baselines (in the paper)

- In addition, four compressed packages are included, of which HDPP is the core of the code. Due to the limitation of the uploaded file capacity, it is selected to be compressed and uploaded.

- If you need the gazebo environment used in the paper, please inform your email, then we will send the download link.
